# TODO
## Major
- Add in page to edit dashboard contents from the browser, instead of manually entering in database queries
- Add way to define order of widgets in a dashboard column aside from DashboardWidget ID
- Generate unique IDs for multiple instances of the same Widget (so the autorotate page will behave as expected when multiple dashboards have the same widget)

## Minor
- Make pretty URLs using DataMapper 
- Custom acronym inflectors
- Refactor stylesheets to use Sass, split them off by component, and only load stylesheets for widgets on current page
